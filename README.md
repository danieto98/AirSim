# AirSim for both cars and drones

This repository follows the work of [IdoMatan](https://github.com/IdoMatan/AirsimAugmentedFiles) and [kshitiz38](https://github.com/kshitiz38/AirSim) by expanding the use of Microsoft AirSim to joint drone and car simulations. It works under the latest version of AirSim and provides support for ROS libraries. For more information on AirSim, visit the [original AirSim repository](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim) or the [AirSim Docs](https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/).
